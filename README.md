### Wait what?
Mojibrag is a PWA, which means it works offline (on Service Worker friendly
browsers). It saves the data in a Firebase instance, and this data is ALSO
available offline. It's also localized, which means you can view it in
your favourite language (Pull Requests for more languages appreciated!).
